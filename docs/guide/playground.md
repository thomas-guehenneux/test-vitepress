# Playground
 
To quickly do some experiment, please check out our [Guard UI Playground](http://wecloudapp.com/guard-ui-playground/)

## Instantly refresh

As you `place` your components on the top left editor, the preview on the right will immediate update. This is the same for the javascript on the bottom left editor.

## Code completion

Our custom tag names are intuitive, so type the names that first come to your mind and mostly likely it is what you want. For example, account-input, login-button etc.
